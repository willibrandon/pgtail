# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
make run      # Run from source
make test     # Run all tests
make lint     # Lint code
make format   # Format code
make build    # Build single executable
make clean    # Remove build artifacts
```

## Architecture

pgtail is an interactive CLI tool for tailing PostgreSQL log files. It auto-detects PostgreSQL instances and provides real-time log streaming with level filtering.

### Package Structure (pgtail_py/)

- `pgtail_py/__main__.py` - Entry point for `python -m pgtail_py`
- `pgtail_py/cli.py` - REPL loop, command handlers, AppState
- `pgtail_py/detector.py` - Platform dispatcher for instance detection
- `pgtail_py/detector_unix.py` - Unix/macOS detection (processes, pgrx, PGDATA, known paths)
- `pgtail_py/detector_windows.py` - Windows-specific detection
- `pgtail_py/instance.py` - Instance dataclass and DetectionSource enum
- `pgtail_py/parser.py` - PostgreSQL log line parsing, LogEntry dataclass
- `pgtail_py/filter.py` - LogLevel enum, level filtering logic
- `pgtail_py/regex_filter.py` - Regex pattern filtering and highlighting
- `pgtail_py/slow_query.py` - Slow query detection, thresholds, duration stats
- `pgtail_py/tailer.py` - Log file tailing with polling (handles rotation)
- `pgtail_py/colors.py` - Color output using prompt_toolkit styles
- `pgtail_py/commands.py` - Command definitions, PgtailCompleter for autocomplete
- `pgtail_py/config.py` - Platform-specific paths (history file)
- `pgtail_py/enable_logging.py` - Enable logging_collector in postgresql.conf

**Detection priority:** Running processes → ~/.pgrx/data-* → PGDATA env → platform-specific paths

**Key dependencies:**
- `prompt_toolkit` - REPL with autocomplete and history
- `psutil` - Cross-platform process detection

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- prompt_toolkit >=3.0.0 (REPL, autocomplete, styled output)
- psutil >=5.9.0 (process detection)
- re (stdlib, regex filtering)

## Recent Changes
- Added slow query detection with configurable thresholds (slow command)
- Added query duration statistics (stats command)
- Color-coded highlighting: yellow (warning), yellow bold (slow), red bold (critical)
